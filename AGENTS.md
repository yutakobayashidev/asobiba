## Learning Journal

After every session where something new is learned, discovered, or debugged, append an entry to `journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using the current date).

### What to log

- New concepts, APIs, or libraries encountered
- Bugs found and their root causes
- Non-obvious behavior or gotchas
- Useful patterns, idioms, or techniques
- Configuration quirks or environment-specific issues
- Mistakes made and how they were resolved

### Format

```markdown
## <Topic>

<What was learned, why it matters, and any context for future reference.>
```

### Rules

- One file per day; append multiple entries throughout the day
- Keep entries concise but specific — future-you should understand the context
- Use code snippets when they clarify the point
- Do NOT skip this step — even small learnings compound over time
- Create the `journals/` directory if it does not exist
