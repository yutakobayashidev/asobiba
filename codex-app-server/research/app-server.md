# Codex App Server

Codex app-server is the interface Codex uses to power rich clients (for example, the Codex VS Code extension). Use it when you want a deep integration inside your own product: authentication, conversation history, approvals, and streamed agent events. The app-server implementation is open source in the Codex GitHub repository ([openai/codex/codex-rs/app-server](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs/app-server)). See the [Open Source](https://developers.openai.com/codex/open-source) page for the full list of open-source Codex components.

If you are automating jobs or running Codex in CI, use the
  <a href="/codex/sdk">Codex SDK</a> instead.

## Protocol

Like [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), `codex app-server` supports bidirectional communication using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages (with the `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` header omitted on the wire).

Supported transports:

- `stdio` (`--listen stdio://`, default): newline-delimited JSON (JSONL).
- `websocket` (`--listen ws://IP:PORT`, experimental): one JSON-RPC message per WebSocket text frame.

In WebSocket mode, app-server uses bounded queues. When request ingress is full, the server rejects new requests with JSON-RPC error code `-32001` and message `"Server overloaded; retry later."` Clients should retry with an exponentially increasing delay and jitter.

## Message schema

Requests include `method`, `params`, and `id`:

```json
{ "method": "thread/start", "id": 10, "params": { "model": "gpt-5.1-codex" } }
```

Responses echo the `id` with either `result` or `error`:

```json
{ "id": 10, "result": { "thread": { "id": "thr_123" } } }
```

```json
{ "id": 10, "error": { "code": 123, "message": "Something went wrong" } }
```

Notifications omit `id` and use only `method` and `params`:

```json
{ "method": "turn/started", "params": { "turn": { "id": "turn_456" } } }
```

You can generate a TypeScript schema or a JSON Schema bundle from the CLI. Each output is specific to the Codex version you ran, so the generated artifacts match that version exactly:

```bash
codex app-server generate-ts --out ./schemas
codex app-server generate-json-schema --out ./schemas
```

## Getting started

1. Start the server with `codex app-server` (default stdio transport) or `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:4500` (experimental WebSocket transport).
2. Connect a client over the selected transport, then send `initialize` followed by the `initialized` notification.
3. Start a thread and a turn, then keep reading notifications from the active transport stream.

Example (Node.js / TypeScript):

```ts



const proc = spawn("codex", ["app-server"], {
  stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "inherit"],
});
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: proc.stdout });

const send = (message: unknown) => {
  proc.stdin.write(`${JSON.stringify(message)}\n`);
};

let threadId: string | null = null;

rl.on("line", (line) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(line) as any;
  console.log("server:", msg);

  if (msg.id === 1 && msg.result?.thread?.id && !threadId) {
    threadId = msg.result.thread.id;
    send({
      method: "turn/start",
      id: 2,
      params: {
        threadId,
        input: [{ type: "text", text: "Summarize this repo." }],
      },
    });
  }
});

send({
  method: "initialize",
  id: 0,
  params: {
    clientInfo: {
      name: "my_product",
      title: "My Product",
      version: "0.1.0",
    },
  },
});
send({ method: "initialized", params: {} });
send({ method: "thread/start", id: 1, params: { model: "gpt-5.1-codex" } });
```

## Core primitives

- **Thread**: A conversation between a user and the Codex agent. Threads contain turns.
- **Turn**: A single user request and the agent work that follows. Turns contain items and stream incremental updates.
- **Item**: A unit of input or output (user message, agent message, command runs, file change, tool call, and more).

Use the thread APIs to create, list, or archive conversations. Drive a conversation with turn APIs and stream progress via turn notifications.

## Lifecycle overview

- **Initialize once per connection**: Immediately after opening a transport connection, send an `initialize` request with your client metadata, then emit `initialized`. The server rejects any request on that connection before this handshake.
- **Start (or resume) a thread**: Call `thread/start` for a new conversation, `thread/resume` to continue an existing one, or `thread/fork` to branch history into a new thread id.
- **Begin a turn**: Call `turn/start` with the target `threadId` and user input. Optional fields override model, personality, `cwd`, sandbox policy, and more.
- **Steer an active turn**: Call `turn/steer` to append user input to the currently in-flight turn without creating a new turn.
- **Stream events**: After `turn/start`, keep reading notifications on stdout: `thread/archived`, `thread/unarchived`, `item/started`, `item/completed`, `item/agentMessage/delta`, tool progress, and other updates.
- **Finish the turn**: The server emits `turn/completed` with final status when the model finishes or after a `turn/interrupt` cancellation.

## Initialization

Clients must send a single `initialize` request per transport connection before invoking any other method on that connection, then acknowledge with an `initialized` notification. Requests sent before initialization receive a `Not initialized` error, and repeated `initialize` calls on the same connection return `Already initialized`.

The server returns the user agent string it will present to upstream services. Set `clientInfo` to identify your integration.

`initialize.params.capabilities` also supports per-connection notification opt-out via `optOutNotificationMethods`, which is a list of exact method names to suppress for that connection. Matching is exact (no wildcards/prefixes). Unknown method names are accepted and ignored.

**Important**: Use `clientInfo.name` to identify your client for the OpenAI Compliance Logs Platform. If you are developing a new Codex integration intended for enterprise use, please contact OpenAI to get it added to a known clients list. For more context, see the [Codex logs reference](https://chatgpt.com/admin/api-reference#tag/Logs:-Codex).

Example (from the Codex VS Code extension):

```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "id": 0,
  "params": {
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "codex_vscode",
      "title": "Codex VS Code Extension",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Example with notification opt-out:

```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "id": 1,
  "params": {
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "my_client",
      "title": "My Client",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "experimentalApi": true,
      "optOutNotificationMethods": [
        "codex/event/session_configured",
        "item/agentMessage/delta"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Experimental API opt-in

Some app-server methods and fields are intentionally gated behind `experimentalApi` capability.

- Omit `capabilities` (or set `experimentalApi` to `false`) to stay on the stable API surface, and the server rejects experimental methods/fields.
- Set `capabilities.experimentalApi` to `true` to enable experimental methods and fields.

```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "id": 1,
  "params": {
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "my_client",
      "title": "My Client",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "experimentalApi": true
    }
  }
}
```

If a client sends an experimental method or field without opting in, app-server rejects it with:

`<descriptor> requires experimentalApi capability`

## API overview

- `thread/start` - create a new thread; emits `thread/started` and automatically subscribes you to turn/item events for that thread.
- `thread/resume` - reopen an existing thread by id so later `turn/start` calls append to it.
- `thread/fork` - fork a thread into a new thread id by copying stored history; emits `thread/started` for the new thread.
- `thread/read` - read a stored thread by id without resuming it; set `includeTurns` to return full turn history. Returned `thread` objects include runtime `status`.
- `thread/list` - page through stored thread logs; supports cursor-based pagination plus `modelProviders`, `sourceKinds`, `archived`, and `cwd` filters. Returned `thread` objects include runtime `status`.
- `thread/loaded/list` - list the thread ids currently loaded in memory.
- `thread/archive` - move a thread's log file into the archived directory; returns `{}` on success and emits `thread/archived`.
- `thread/unarchive` - restore an archived thread rollout back into the active sessions directory; returns the restored `thread` and emits `thread/unarchived`.
- `thread/status/changed` - notification emitted when a loaded thread's runtime `status` changes.
- `thread/compact/start` - trigger conversation history compaction for a thread; returns `{}` immediately while progress streams via `turn/*` and `item/*` notifications.
- `thread/rollback` - drop the last N turns from the in-memory context and persist a rollback marker; returns the updated `thread`.
- `turn/start` - add user input to a thread and begin Codex generation; responds with the initial `turn` and streams events. For `collaborationMode`, `settings.developer_instructions: null` means "use built-in instructions for the selected mode."
- `turn/steer` - append user input to the active in-flight turn for a thread; returns the accepted `turnId`.
- `turn/interrupt` - request cancellation of an in-flight turn; success is `{}` and the turn ends with `status: "interrupted"`.
- `review/start` - kick off the Codex reviewer for a thread; emits `enteredReviewMode` and `exitedReviewMode` items.
- `command/exec` - run a single command under the server sandbox without starting a thread/turn.
- `model/list` - list available models (set `includeHidden: true` to include entries with `hidden: true`) with effort options, optional `upgrade`, and `inputModalities`.
- `experimentalFeature/list` - list feature flags with lifecycle stage metadata and cursor pagination.
- `collaborationMode/list` - list collaboration mode presets (experimental, no pagination).
- `skills/list` - list skills for one or more `cwd` values (supports `forceReload` and optional `perCwdExtraUserRoots`).
- `app/list` - list available apps (connectors) with pagination plus accessibility/enabled metadata.
- `skills/config/write` - enable or disable skills by path.
- `mcpServer/oauth/login` - start an OAuth login for a configured MCP server; returns an authorization URL and emits `mcpServer/oauthLogin/completed` on completion.
- `tool/requestUserInput` - prompt the user with 1-3 short questions for a tool call (experimental); questions can set `isOther` for a free-form option.
- `config/mcpServer/reload` - reload MCP server configuration from disk and queue a refresh for loaded threads.
- `mcpServerStatus/list` - list MCP servers, tools, resources, and auth status (cursor + limit pagination).
- `windowsSandbox/setupStart` - start Windows sandbox setup for `elevated` or `unelevated` mode; returns quickly and later emits `windowsSandbox/setupCompleted`.
- `feedback/upload` - submit a feedback report (classification + optional reason/logs + conversation id, plus optional `extraLogFiles` attachments).
- `config/read` - fetch the effective configuration on disk after resolving configuration layering.
- `config/value/write` - write a single configuration key/value to the user's `config.toml` on disk.
- `config/batchWrite` - apply configuration edits atomically to the user's `config.toml` on disk.
- `configRequirements/read` - fetch requirements from `requirements.toml` and/or MDM, including allow-lists and residency requirements (or `null` if you haven't set any up).

## Models

### List models (`model/list`)

Call `model/list` to discover available models and their capabilities before rendering model or personality selectors.

```json
{ "method": "model/list", "id": 6, "params": { "limit": 20, "includeHidden": false } }
{ "id": 6, "result": {
  "data": [{
    "id": "gpt-5.2-codex",
    "model": "gpt-5.2-codex",
    "upgrade": "gpt-5.3-codex",
    "displayName": "GPT-5.2 Codex",
    "hidden": false,
    "defaultReasoningEffort": "medium",
    "reasoningEffort": [{
      "effort": "low",
      "description": "Lower latency"
    }],
    "inputModalities": ["text", "image"],
    "supportsPersonality": true,
    "isDefault": true
  }],
  "nextCursor": null
} }
```

Each model entry can include:

- `reasoningEffort` - supported effort options for the model.
- `defaultReasoningEffort` - suggested default effort for clients.
- `upgrade` - optional recommended upgrade model id for migration prompts in clients.
- `hidden` - whether the model is hidden from the default picker list.
- `inputModalities` - supported input types for the model (for example `text`, `image`).
- `supportsPersonality` - whether the model supports personality-specific instructions such as `/personality`.
- `isDefault` - whether the model is the recommended default.

By default, `model/list` returns picker-visible models only. Set `includeHidden: true` if you need the full list and want to filter on the client side using `hidden`.

When `inputModalities` is missing (older model catalogs), treat it as `["text", "image"]` for backward compatibility.

### List experimental features (`experimentalFeature/list`)

Use this endpoint to discover feature flags with metadata and lifecycle stage:

```json
{ "method": "experimentalFeature/list", "id": 7, "params": { "limit": 20 } }
{ "id": 7, "result": {
  "data": [{
    "name": "unified_exec",
    "stage": "beta",
    "displayName": "Unified exec",
    "description": "Use the unified PTY-backed execution tool.",
    "announcement": "Beta rollout for improved command execution reliability.",
    "enabled": false,
    "defaultEnabled": false
  }],
  "nextCursor": null
} }
```

`stage` can be `beta`, `underDevelopment`, `stable`, `deprecated`, or `removed`. For non-beta flags, `displayName`, `description`, and `announcement` may be `null`.

## Threads

- `thread/read` reads a stored thread without subscribing to it; set `includeTurns` to include turns.
- `thread/list` supports cursor pagination plus `modelProviders`, `sourceKinds`, `archived`, and `cwd` filtering.
- `thread/loaded/list` returns the thread IDs currently in memory.
- `thread/archive` moves the thread's persisted JSONL log into the archived directory.
- `thread/unarchive` restores an archived thread rollout back into the active sessions directory.
- `thread/compact/start` triggers compaction and returns `{}` immediately.
- `thread/rollback` drops the last N turns from the in-memory context and records a rollback marker in the thread's persisted JSONL log.

### Start or resume a thread

Start a fresh thread when you need a new Codex conversation.

```json
{ "method": "thread/start", "id": 10, "params": {
  "model": "gpt-5.1-codex",
  "cwd": "/Users/me/project",
  "approvalPolicy": "never",
  "sandbox": "workspaceWrite",
  "personality": "friendly"
} }
{ "id": 10, "result": {
  "thread": {
    "id": "thr_123",
    "preview": "",
    "modelProvider": "openai",
    "createdAt": 1730910000
  }
} }
{ "method": "thread/started", "params": { "thread": { "id": "thr_123" } } }
```

To continue a stored session, call `thread/resume` with the `thread.id` you recorded earlier. The response shape matches `thread/start`. You can also pass the same configuration overrides supported by `thread/start`, such as `personality`:

```json
{ "method": "thread/resume", "id": 11, "params": {
  "threadId": "thr_123",
  "personality": "friendly"
} }
{ "id": 11, "result": { "thread": { "id": "thr_123", "name": "Bug bash notes" } } }
```

Resuming a thread doesn't update `thread.updatedAt` (or the rollout file's modified time) by itself. The timestamp updates when you start a turn.

If you mark an enabled MCP server as `required` in config and that server fails to initialize, `thread/start` and `thread/resume` fail instead of continuing without it.

`dynamicTools` on `thread/start` is an experimental field (requires `capabilities.experimentalApi = true`). Codex persists these dynamic tools in the thread rollout metadata and restores them on `thread/resume` when you don't supply new dynamic tools.

If you resume with a different model than the one recorded in the rollout, Codex emits a warning and applies a one-time model-switch instruction on the next turn.

To branch from a stored session, call `thread/fork` with the `thread.id`. This creates a new thread id and emits a `thread/started` notification for it:

```json
{ "method": "thread/fork", "id": 12, "params": { "threadId": "thr_123" } }
{ "id": 12, "result": { "thread": { "id": "thr_456" } } }
{ "method": "thread/started", "params": { "thread": { "id": "thr_456" } } }
```

When a user-facing thread title has been set, app-server hydrates `thread.name` on `thread/list`, `thread/read`, `thread/resume`, `thread/unarchive`, and `thread/rollback` responses. `thread/start` and `thread/fork` may omit `name` (or return `null`) until a title is set later.

### Read a stored thread (without resuming)

Use `thread/read` when you want stored thread data but don't want to resume the thread or subscribe to its events.

- `includeTurns` - when `true`, the response includes the thread's turns; when `false` or omitted, you get the thread summary only.
- Returned `thread` objects include runtime `status` (`notLoaded`, `idle`, `systemError`, or `active` with `activeFlags`).

```json
{ "method": "thread/read", "id": 19, "params": { "threadId": "thr_123", "includeTurns": true } }
{ "id": 19, "result": { "thread": { "id": "thr_123", "name": "Bug bash notes", "status": { "type": "notLoaded" }, "turns": [] } } }
```

Unlike `thread/resume`, `thread/read` doesn't load the thread into memory or emit `thread/started`.

### List threads (with pagination & filters)

`thread/list` lets you render a history UI. Results default to newest-first by `createdAt`. Filters apply before pagination. Pass any combination of:

- `cursor` - opaque string from a prior response; omit for the first page.
- `limit` - server defaults to a reasonable page size if unset.
- `sortKey` - `created_at` (default) or `updated_at`.
- `modelProviders` - restrict results to specific providers; unset, null, or an empty array includes all providers.
- `sourceKinds` - restrict results to specific thread sources. When omitted or `[]`, the server defaults to interactive sources only: `cli` and `vscode`.
- `archived` - when `true`, list archived threads only. When `false` or omitted, list non-archived threads (default).
- `cwd` - restrict results to threads whose session current working directory exactly matches this path.

`sourceKinds` accepts the following values:

- `cli`
- `vscode`
- `exec`
- `appServer`
- `subAgent`
- `subAgentReview`
- `subAgentCompact`
- `subAgentThreadSpawn`
- `subAgentOther`
- `unknown`

Example:

```json
{ "method": "thread/list", "id": 20, "params": {
  "cursor": null,
  "limit": 25,
  "sortKey": "created_at"
} }
{ "id": 20, "result": {
  "data": [
    { "id": "thr_a", "preview": "Create a TUI", "modelProvider": "openai", "createdAt": 1730831111, "updatedAt": 1730831111, "name": "TUI prototype", "status": { "type": "notLoaded" } },
    { "id": "thr_b", "preview": "Fix tests", "modelProvider": "openai", "createdAt": 1730750000, "updatedAt": 1730750000, "status": { "type": "notLoaded" } }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque-token-or-null"
} }
```

When `nextCursor` is `null`, you have reached the final page.

### Track thread status changes

`thread/status/changed` is emitted whenever a loaded thread's runtime status changes. The payload includes `threadId` and the new `status`.

```json
{
  "method": "thread/status/changed",
  "params": {
    "threadId": "thr_123",
    "status": { "type": "active", "activeFlags": ["waitingOnApproval"] }
  }
}
```

### List loaded threads

`thread/loaded/list` returns thread IDs currently loaded in memory.

```json
{ "method": "thread/loaded/list", "id": 21 }
{ "id": 21, "result": { "data": ["thr_123", "thr_456"] } }
```

### Archive a thread

Use `thread/archive` to move the persisted thread log (stored as a JSONL file on disk) into the archived sessions directory.

```json
{ "method": "thread/archive", "id": 22, "params": { "threadId": "thr_b" } }
{ "id": 22, "result": {} }
{ "method": "thread/archived", "params": { "threadId": "thr_b" } }
```

Archived threads won't appear in future calls to `thread/list` unless you pass `archived: true`.

### Unarchive a thread

Use `thread/unarchive` to move an archived thread rollout back into the active sessions directory.

```json
{ "method": "thread/unarchive", "id": 24, "params": { "threadId": "thr_b" } }
{ "id": 24, "result": { "thread": { "id": "thr_b", "name": "Bug bash notes" } } }
{ "method": "thread/unarchived", "params": { "threadId": "thr_b" } }
```

### Trigger thread compaction

Use `thread/compact/start` to trigger manual history compaction for a thread. The request returns immediately with `{}`.

App-server emits progress as standard `turn/*` and `item/*` notifications on the same `threadId`, including a `contextCompaction` item lifecycle (`item/started` then `item/completed`).

```json
{ "method": "thread/compact/start", "id": 25, "params": { "threadId": "thr_b" } }
{ "id": 25, "result": {} }
```

## Turns

The `input` field accepts a list of items:

- `{ "type": "text", "text": "Explain this diff" }`
- `{ "type": "image", "url": "https://.../design.png" }`
- `{ "type": "localImage", "path": "/tmp/screenshot.png" }`

You can override configuration settings per turn (model, effort, personality, `cwd`, sandbox policy, summary). When specified, these settings become the defaults for later turns on the same thread. `outputSchema` applies only to the current turn. For `sandboxPolicy.type = "externalSandbox"`, set `networkAccess` to `restricted` or `enabled`; for `workspaceWrite`, `networkAccess` remains a boolean.

For `turn/start.collaborationMode`, `settings.developer_instructions: null` means "use built-in instructions for the selected mode" rather than clearing mode instructions.

### Sandbox read access (`ReadOnlyAccess`)

`sandboxPolicy` supports explicit read-access controls:

- `readOnly`: optional `access` (`{ "type": "fullAccess" }` by default, or restricted roots).
- `workspaceWrite`: optional `readOnlyAccess` (`{ "type": "fullAccess" }` by default, or restricted roots).

Restricted read access shape:

```json
{
  "type": "restricted",
  "includePlatformDefaults": true,
  "readableRoots": ["/Users/me/shared-read-only"]
}
```

On macOS, `includePlatformDefaults: true` appends a curated platform-default Seatbelt policy for restricted-read sessions. This improves tool compatibility without broadly allowing all of `/System`.

Examples:

```json
{ "type": "readOnly", "access": { "type": "fullAccess" } }
```

```json
{
  "type": "workspaceWrite",
  "writableRoots": ["/Users/me/project"],
  "readOnlyAccess": {
    "type": "restricted",
    "includePlatformDefaults": true,
    "readableRoots": ["/Users/me/shared-read-only"]
  },
  "networkAccess": false
}
```

### Start a turn

```json
{ "method": "turn/start", "id": 30, "params": {
  "threadId": "thr_123",
  "input": [ { "type": "text", "text": "Run tests" } ],
  "cwd": "/Users/me/project",
  "approvalPolicy": "unlessTrusted",
  "sandboxPolicy": {
    "type": "workspaceWrite",
    "writableRoots": ["/Users/me/project"],
    "networkAccess": true
  },
  "model": "gpt-5.1-codex",
  "effort": "medium",
  "summary": "concise",
  "personality": "friendly",
  "outputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { "answer": { "type": "string" } },
    "required": ["answer"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
} }
{ "id": 30, "result": { "turn": { "id": "turn_456", "status": "inProgress", "items": [], "error": null } } }
```

### Steer an active turn

Use `turn/steer` to append more user input to the active in-flight turn.

- Include `expectedTurnId`; it must match the active turn id.
- The request fails if there is no active turn on the thread.
- `turn/steer` doesn't emit a new `turn/started` notification.
- `turn/steer` doesn't accept turn-level overrides (`model`, `cwd`, `sandboxPolicy`, or `outputSchema`).

```json
{ "method": "turn/steer", "id": 32, "params": {
  "threadId": "thr_123",
  "input": [ { "type": "text", "text": "Actually focus on failing tests first." } ],
  "expectedTurnId": "turn_456"
} }
{ "id": 32, "result": { "turnId": "turn_456" } }
```

### Start a turn (invoke a skill)

Invoke a skill explicitly by including `$<skill-name>` in the text input and adding a `skill` input item alongside it.

```json
{ "method": "turn/start", "id": 33, "params": {
  "threadId": "thr_123",
  "input": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "$skill-creator Add a new skill for triaging flaky CI and include step-by-step usage." },
    { "type": "skill", "name": "skill-creator", "path": "/Users/me/.codex/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md" }
  ]
} }
{ "id": 33, "result": { "turn": { "id": "turn_457", "status": "inProgress", "items": [], "error": null } } }
```

### Interrupt a turn

```json
{ "method": "turn/interrupt", "id": 31, "params": { "threadId": "thr_123", "turnId": "turn_456" } }
{ "id": 31, "result": {} }
```

On success, the turn finishes with `status: "interrupted"`.

## Review

`review/start` runs the Codex reviewer for a thread and streams review items. Targets include:

- `uncommittedChanges`
- `baseBranch` (diff against a branch)
- `commit` (review a specific commit)
- `custom` (free-form instructions)

Use `delivery: "inline"` (default) to run the review on the existing thread, or `delivery: "detached"` to fork a new review thread.

Example request/response:

```json
{ "method": "review/start", "id": 40, "params": {
  "threadId": "thr_123",
  "delivery": "inline",
  "target": { "type": "commit", "sha": "1234567deadbeef", "title": "Polish tui colors" }
} }
{ "id": 40, "result": {
  "turn": {
    "id": "turn_900",
    "status": "inProgress",
    "items": [
      { "type": "userMessage", "id": "turn_900", "content": [ { "type": "text", "text": "Review commit 1234567: Polish tui colors" } ] }
    ],
    "error": null
  },
  "reviewThreadId": "thr_123"
} }
```

For a detached review, use `"delivery": "detached"`. The response is the same shape, but `reviewThreadId` will be the id of the new review thread (different from the original `threadId`). The server also emits a `thread/started` notification for that new thread before streaming the review turn.

Codex streams the usual `turn/started` notification followed by an `item/started` with an `enteredReviewMode` item:

```json
{
  "method": "item/started",
  "params": {
    "item": {
      "type": "enteredReviewMode",
      "id": "turn_900",
      "review": "current changes"
    }
  }
}
```

When the reviewer finishes, the server emits `item/started` and `item/completed` containing an `exitedReviewMode` item with the final review text:

```json
{
  "method": "item/completed",
  "params": {
    "item": {
      "type": "exitedReviewMode",
      "id": "turn_900",
      "review": "Looks solid overall..."
    }
  }
}
```

Use this notification to render the reviewer output in your client.

## Command execution

`command/exec` runs a single command (`argv` array) under the server sandbox without creating a thread.

```json
{ "method": "command/exec", "id": 50, "params": {
  "command": ["ls", "-la"],
  "cwd": "/Users/me/project",
  "sandboxPolicy": { "type": "workspaceWrite" },
  "timeoutMs": 10000
} }
{ "id": 50, "result": { "exitCode": 0, "stdout": "...", "stderr": "" } }
```

Use `sandboxPolicy.type = "externalSandbox"` if you already sandbox the server process and want Codex to skip its own sandbox enforcement. For external sandbox mode, set `networkAccess` to `restricted` (default) or `enabled`. For `readOnly` and `workspaceWrite`, use the same optional `access` / `readOnlyAccess` structure shown above.

Notes:

- The server rejects empty `command` arrays.
- `sandboxPolicy` accepts the same shape used by `turn/start` (for example, `dangerFullAccess`, `readOnly`, `workspaceWrite`, `externalSandbox`).
- When omitted, `timeoutMs` falls back to the server default.

### Read admin requirements (`configRequirements/read`)

Use `configRequirements/read` to inspect the effective admin requirements loaded from `requirements.toml` and/or MDM.

```json
{ "method": "configRequirements/read", "id": 52, "params": {} }
{ "id": 52, "result": {
  "requirements": {
    "allowedApprovalPolicies": ["onRequest", "unlessTrusted"],
    "allowedSandboxModes": ["readOnly", "workspaceWrite"],
    "network": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedDomains": ["api.openai.com"],
      "allowUnixSockets": ["/tmp/example.sock"],
      "dangerouslyAllowAllUnixSockets": false
    }
  }
} }
```

`result.requirements` is `null` when no requirements are configured. When present, the optional `network` object carries managed proxy constraints (domain rules, proxy settings, and unix-socket policy).

### Windows sandbox setup (`windowsSandbox/setupStart`)

Custom Windows clients can trigger sandbox setup asynchronously instead of blocking on startup checks.

```json
{ "method": "windowsSandbox/setupStart", "id": 53, "params": { "mode": "elevated" } }
{ "id": 53, "result": { "started": true } }
```

App-server starts setup in the background and later emits a completion notification:

```json
{
  "method": "windowsSandbox/setupCompleted",
  "params": { "mode": "elevated", "success": true, "error": null }
}
```

Modes:

- `elevated` - run the elevated Windows sandbox setup path.
- `unelevated` - run the legacy setup/preflight path.

## Events

Event notifications are the server-initiated stream for thread lifecycles, turn lifecycles, and the items within them. After you start or resume a thread, keep reading the active transport stream for `thread/started`, `thread/archived`, `thread/unarchived`, `thread/status/changed`, `turn/*`, and `item/*` notifications.

### Notification opt-out

Clients can suppress specific notifications per connection by sending exact method names in `initialize.params.capabilities.optOutNotificationMethods`.

- Exact-match only: `item/agentMessage/delta` suppresses only that method.
- Unknown method names are ignored.
- Applies to both legacy (`codex/event/*`) and v2 (`thread/*`, `turn/*`, `item/*`, etc.) notifications.
- Doesn't apply to requests, responses, or errors.

### Fuzzy file search events (experimental)

The fuzzy file search session API emits per-query notifications:

- `fuzzyFileSearch/sessionUpdated` - `{ sessionId, query, files }` with the current matches for the active query.
- `fuzzyFileSearch/sessionCompleted` - `{ sessionId }` once indexing and matching for that query completes.

### Windows sandbox setup events

- `windowsSandbox/setupCompleted` - `{ mode, success, error }` emitted after a `windowsSandbox/setupStart` request finishes.

### Turn events

- `turn/started` - `{ turn }` with the turn id, empty `items`, and `status: "inProgress"`.
- `turn/completed` - `{ turn }` where `turn.status` is `completed`, `interrupted`, or `failed`; failures carry `{ error: { message, codexErrorInfo?, additionalDetails? } }`.
- `turn/diff/updated` - `{ threadId, turnId, diff }` with the latest aggregated unified diff across every file change in the turn.
- `turn/plan/updated` - `{ turnId, explanation?, plan }` whenever the agent shares or changes its plan; each `plan` entry is `{ step, status }` with `status` in `pending`, `inProgress`, or `completed`.
- `thread/tokenUsage/updated` - usage updates for the active thread.

`turn/diff/updated` and `turn/plan/updated` currently include empty `items` arrays even when item events stream. Use `item/*` notifications as the source of truth for turn items.

### Items

`ThreadItem` is the tagged union carried in turn responses and `item/*` notifications. Common item types include:

- `userMessage` - `{id, content}` where `content` is a list of user inputs (`text`, `image`, or `localImage`).
- `agentMessage` - `{id, text, phase?}` containing the accumulated agent reply. When present, `phase` uses Responses API wire values (`commentary`, `final_answer`).
- `plan` - `{id, text}` containing proposed plan text in plan mode. Treat the final `plan` item from `item/completed` as authoritative.
- `reasoning` - `{id, summary, content}` where `summary` holds streamed reasoning summaries and `content` holds raw reasoning blocks.
- `commandExecution` - `{id, command, cwd, status, commandActions, aggregatedOutput?, exitCode?, durationMs?}`.
- `fileChange` - `{id, changes, status}` describing proposed edits; `changes` list `{path, kind, diff}`.
- `mcpToolCall` - `{id, server, tool, status, arguments, result?, error?}`.
- `collabToolCall` - `{id, tool, status, senderThreadId, receiverThreadId?, newThreadId?, prompt?, agentStatus?}`.
- `webSearch` - `{id, query, action?}` for web search requests issued by the agent.
- `imageView` - `{id, path}` emitted when the agent invokes the image viewer tool.
- `enteredReviewMode` - `{id, review}` sent when the reviewer starts.
- `exitedReviewMode` - `{id, review}` emitted when the reviewer finishes.
- `contextCompaction` - `{id}` emitted when Codex compacts the conversation history.

For `webSearch.action`, the action `type` can be `search` (`query?`, `queries?`), `openPage` (`url?`), or `findInPage` (`url?`, `pattern?`).

The app server deprecates the legacy `thread/compacted` notification; use the `contextCompaction` item instead.

All items emit two shared lifecycle events:

- `item/started` - emits the full `item` when a new unit of work begins; the `item.id` matches the `itemId` used by deltas.
- `item/completed` - sends the final `item` once work finishes; treat this as the authoritative state.

### Item deltas

- `item/agentMessage/delta` - appends streamed text for the agent message.
- `item/plan/delta` - streams proposed plan text. The final `plan` item may not exactly equal the concatenated deltas.
- `item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta` - streams readable reasoning summaries; `summaryIndex` increments when a new summary section opens.
- `item/reasoning/summaryPartAdded` - marks a boundary between reasoning summary sections.
- `item/reasoning/textDelta` - streams raw reasoning text (when supported by the model).
- `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` - streams stdout/stderr for a command; append deltas in order.
- `item/fileChange/outputDelta` - contains the tool call response of the underlying `apply_patch` tool call.

## Errors

If a turn fails, the server emits an `error` event with `{ error: { message, codexErrorInfo?, additionalDetails? } }` and then finishes the turn with `status: "failed"`. When an upstream HTTP status is available, it appears in `codexErrorInfo.httpStatusCode`.

Common `codexErrorInfo` values include:

- `ContextWindowExceeded`
- `UsageLimitExceeded`
- `HttpConnectionFailed` (4xx/5xx upstream errors)
- `ResponseStreamConnectionFailed`
- `ResponseStreamDisconnected`
- `ResponseTooManyFailedAttempts`
- `BadRequest`, `Unauthorized`, `SandboxError`, `InternalServerError`, `Other`

When an upstream HTTP status is available, the server forwards it in `httpStatusCode` on the relevant `codexErrorInfo` variant.

## Approvals

Depending on a user's Codex settings, command execution and file changes may require approval. The app-server sends a server-initiated JSON-RPC request to the client, and the client responds with a decision payload.

- Command execution decisions: `accept`, `acceptForSession`, `decline`, `cancel`, or `{ "acceptWithExecpolicyAmendment": { "execpolicy_amendment": ["cmd", "..."] } }`.
- File change decisions: `accept`, `acceptForSession`, `decline`, `cancel`.

- Requests include `threadId` and `turnId` - use them to scope UI state to the active conversation.
- The server resumes or declines the work and ends the item with `item/completed`.

### Command execution approvals

Order of messages:

1. `item/started` shows the pending `commandExecution` item with `command`, `cwd`, and other fields.
2. `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` includes `itemId`, `threadId`, `turnId`, optional `reason`, optional `command`, optional `cwd`, optional `commandActions`, optional `proposedExecpolicyAmendment`, and optional `networkApprovalContext`.
3. Client responds with one of the command execution approval decisions above.
4. `item/completed` returns the final `commandExecution` item with `status: completed | failed | declined`.

When `networkApprovalContext` is present, the prompt is for managed network access (not a general shell-command approval). The current v2 schema exposes the target `host` and `protocol`; clients should render a network-specific prompt and not rely on `command` being a user-meaningful shell command preview.

Codex deduplicates concurrent network approval prompts by destination (`host`, protocol, and port). The app-server may therefore send one prompt that unblocks multiple queued requests to the same destination, while different ports on the same host are treated separately.

### File change approvals

Order of messages:

1. `item/started` emits a `fileChange` item with proposed `changes` and `status: "inProgress"`.
2. `item/fileChange/requestApproval` includes `itemId`, `threadId`, `turnId`, optional `reason`, and optional `grantRoot`.
3. Client responds with one of the file change approval decisions above.
4. `item/completed` returns the final `fileChange` item with `status: completed | failed | declined`.

### MCP tool-call approvals (apps)

App (connector) tool calls can also require approval. When an app tool call has side effects, the server may elicit approval with `tool/requestUserInput` and options such as **Accept**, **Decline**, and **Cancel**. Destructive tool annotations always trigger approval even when the tool also advertises less-privileged hints. If the user declines or cancels, the related `mcpToolCall` item completes with an error instead of running the tool.

## Skills

Invoke a skill by including `$<skill-name>` in the user text input. Add a `skill` input item (recommended) so the server injects full skill instructions instead of relying on the model to resolve the name.

```json
{
  "method": "turn/start",
  "id": 101,
  "params": {
    "threadId": "thread-1",
    "input": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "$skill-creator Add a new skill for triaging flaky CI."
      },
      {
        "type": "skill",
        "name": "skill-creator",
        "path": "/Users/me/.codex/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you omit the `skill` item, the model will still parse the `$<skill-name>` marker and try to locate the skill, which can add latency.

Example:

```
$skill-creator Add a new skill for triaging flaky CI and include step-by-step usage.
```

Use `skills/list` to fetch available skills (optionally scoped by `cwds`, with `forceReload`). You can also include `perCwdExtraUserRoots` to scan extra absolute paths as `user` scope for specific `cwd` values. App-server ignores entries whose `cwd` isn't present in `cwds`. `skills/list` may reuse a cached result per `cwd`; set `forceReload: true` to refresh from disk. When present, the server reads `interface` and `dependencies` from `SKILL.json`.

```json
{ "method": "skills/list", "id": 25, "params": {
  "cwds": ["/Users/me/project", "/Users/me/other-project"],
  "forceReload": true,
  "perCwdExtraUserRoots": [
    {
      "cwd": "/Users/me/project",
      "extraUserRoots": ["/Users/me/shared-skills"]
    }
  ]
} }
{ "id": 25, "result": {
  "data": [{
    "cwd": "/Users/me/project",
    "skills": [
      {
        "name": "skill-creator",
        "description": "Create or update a Codex skill",
        "enabled": true,
        "interface": {
          "displayName": "Skill Creator",
          "shortDescription": "Create or update a Codex skill"
        },
        "dependencies": {
          "tools": [
            {
              "type": "env_var",
              "value": "GITHUB_TOKEN",
              "description": "GitHub API token"
            },
            {
              "type": "mcp",
              "value": "github",
              "transport": "streamable_http",
              "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "errors": []
  }]
} }
```

To enable or disable a skill by path:

```json
{
  "method": "skills/config/write",
  "id": 26,
  "params": {
    "path": "/Users/me/.codex/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md",
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

## Apps (connectors)

Use `app/list` to fetch available apps. In the CLI/TUI, `/apps` is the user-facing picker; in custom clients, call `app/list` directly. Each entry includes both `isAccessible` (available to the user) and `isEnabled` (enabled in `config.toml`) so clients can distinguish install/access from local enabled state. App entries can also include optional `branding`, `appMetadata`, and `labels` fields.

```json
{ "method": "app/list", "id": 50, "params": {
  "cursor": null,
  "limit": 50,
  "threadId": "thread-1",
  "forceRefetch": false
} }
{ "id": 50, "result": {
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "demo-app",
      "name": "Demo App",
      "description": "Example connector for documentation.",
      "logoUrl": "https://example.com/demo-app.png",
      "logoUrlDark": null,
      "distributionChannel": null,
      "branding": null,
      "appMetadata": null,
      "labels": null,
      "installUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/apps/demo-app/demo-app",
      "isAccessible": true,
      "isEnabled": true
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": null
} }
```

If you provide `threadId`, app feature gating (`features.apps`) uses that thread's config snapshot. When omitted, app-server uses the latest global config.

`app/list` returns after both accessible apps and directory apps load. Set `forceRefetch: true` to bypass app caches and fetch fresh data. Cache entries are only replaced when refreshes succeed.

The server also emits `app/list/updated` notifications whenever either source (accessible apps or directory apps) finishes loading. Each notification includes the latest merged app list.

```json
{
  "method": "app/list/updated",
  "params": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "demo-app",
        "name": "Demo App",
        "description": "Example connector for documentation.",
        "logoUrl": "https://example.com/demo-app.png",
        "logoUrlDark": null,
        "distributionChannel": null,
        "branding": null,
        "appMetadata": null,
        "labels": null,
        "installUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/apps/demo-app/demo-app",
        "isAccessible": true,
        "isEnabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Invoke an app by inserting `$<app-slug>` in the text input and adding a `mention` input item with the `app://<id>` path (recommended).

```json
{
  "method": "turn/start",
  "id": 51,
  "params": {
    "threadId": "thread-1",
    "input": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "$demo-app Pull the latest updates from the team."
      },
      {
        "type": "mention",
        "name": "Demo App",
        "path": "app://demo-app"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Config RPC examples for app settings

Use `config/read`, `config/value/write`, and `config/batchWrite` to inspect or update app controls in `config.toml`.

Read the effective app config shape (including `_default` and per-tool overrides):

```json
{ "method": "config/read", "id": 60, "params": { "includeLayers": false } }
{ "id": 60, "result": {
  "config": {
    "apps": {
      "_default": {
        "enabled": true,
        "destructive_enabled": true,
        "open_world_enabled": true
      },
      "google_drive": {
        "enabled": true,
        "destructive_enabled": false,
        "default_tools_approval_mode": "prompt",
        "tools": {
          "files/delete": { "enabled": false, "approval_mode": "approve" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
} }
```

Update a single app setting:

```json
{
  "method": "config/value/write",
  "id": 61,
  "params": {
    "keyPath": "apps.google_drive.default_tools_approval_mode",
    "value": "prompt",
    "mergeStrategy": "replace"
  }
}
```

Apply multiple app edits atomically:

```json
{
  "method": "config/batchWrite",
  "id": 62,
  "params": {
    "edits": [
      {
        "keyPath": "apps._default.destructive_enabled",
        "value": false,
        "mergeStrategy": "upsert"
      },
      {
        "keyPath": "apps.google_drive.tools.files/delete.approval_mode",
        "value": "approve",
        "mergeStrategy": "upsert"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Auth endpoints

The JSON-RPC auth/account surface exposes request/response methods plus server-initiated notifications (no `id`). Use these to determine auth state, start or cancel logins, logout, and inspect ChatGPT rate limits.

### Authentication modes

Codex supports three authentication modes. `account/updated.authMode` shows the active mode, and `account/read` also reports it.

- **API key (`apikey`)** - the caller supplies an OpenAI API key and Codex stores it for API requests.
- **ChatGPT managed (`chatgpt`)** - Codex owns the ChatGPT OAuth flow, persists tokens, and refreshes them automatically.
- **ChatGPT external tokens (`chatgptAuthTokens`)** - a host app supplies `idToken` and `accessToken` directly. Codex stores these tokens in memory, and the host app must refresh them when asked.

### API overview

- `account/read` - fetch current account info; optionally refresh tokens.
- `account/login/start` - begin login (`apiKey`, `chatgpt`, or `chatgptAuthTokens`).
- `account/login/completed` (notify) - emitted when a login attempt finishes (success or error).
- `account/login/cancel` - cancel a pending ChatGPT login by `loginId`.
- `account/logout` - sign out; triggers `account/updated`.
- `account/updated` (notify) - emitted whenever auth mode changes (`authMode`: `apikey`, `chatgpt`, `chatgptAuthTokens`, or `null`).
- `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` (server request) - request fresh externally managed ChatGPT tokens after an authorization error.
- `account/rateLimits/read` - fetch ChatGPT rate limits.
- `account/rateLimits/updated` (notify) - emitted whenever a user's ChatGPT rate limits change.
- `mcpServer/oauthLogin/completed` (notify) - emitted after a `mcpServer/oauth/login` flow finishes; payload includes `{ name, success, error? }`.

### 1) Check auth state

Request:

```json
{ "method": "account/read", "id": 1, "params": { "refreshToken": false } }
```

Response examples:

```json
{ "id": 1, "result": { "account": null, "requiresOpenaiAuth": false } }
```

```json
{ "id": 1, "result": { "account": null, "requiresOpenaiAuth": true } }
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "result": { "account": { "type": "apiKey" }, "requiresOpenaiAuth": true }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "account": {
      "type": "chatgpt",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "planType": "pro"
    },
    "requiresOpenaiAuth": true
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `refreshToken` (boolean): set `true` to force a token refresh in managed ChatGPT mode. In external token mode (`chatgptAuthTokens`), app-server ignores this flag.
- `requiresOpenaiAuth` reflects the active provider; when `false`, Codex can run without OpenAI credentials.

### 2) Log in with an API key

1. Send:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/login/start",
     "id": 2,
     "params": { "type": "apiKey", "apiKey": "sk-..." }
   }
   ```

2. Expect:

   ```json
   { "id": 2, "result": { "type": "apiKey" } }
   ```

3. Notifications:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/login/completed",
     "params": { "loginId": null, "success": true, "error": null }
   }
   ```

   ```json
   { "method": "account/updated", "params": { "authMode": "apikey" } }
   ```

### 3) Log in with ChatGPT (browser flow)

1. Start:

   ```json
   { "method": "account/login/start", "id": 3, "params": { "type": "chatgpt" } }
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "id": 3,
     "result": {
       "type": "chatgpt",
       "loginId": "<uuid>",
       "authUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/...&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A<port>%2Fauth%2Fcallback"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Open `authUrl` in a browser; the app-server hosts the local callback.
3. Wait for notifications:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/login/completed",
     "params": { "loginId": "<uuid>", "success": true, "error": null }
   }
   ```

   ```json
   { "method": "account/updated", "params": { "authMode": "chatgpt" } }
   ```

### 3b) Log in with externally managed ChatGPT tokens (`chatgptAuthTokens`)

Use this mode when a host application owns the user's ChatGPT auth lifecycle and supplies tokens directly.

1. Send:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/login/start",
     "id": 7,
     "params": {
       "type": "chatgptAuthTokens",
       "idToken": "<jwt>",
       "accessToken": "<jwt>"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Expect:

   ```json
   { "id": 7, "result": { "type": "chatgptAuthTokens" } }
   ```

3. Notifications:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/login/completed",
     "params": { "loginId": null, "success": true, "error": null }
   }
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "method": "account/updated",
     "params": { "authMode": "chatgptAuthTokens" }
   }
   ```

When the server receives a `401 Unauthorized`, it may request refreshed tokens from the host app:

```json
{
  "method": "account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh",
  "id": 8,
  "params": { "reason": "unauthorized", "previousAccountId": "org-123" }
}
{ "id": 8, "result": { "idToken": "<jwt>", "accessToken": "<jwt>" } }
```

The server retries the original request after a successful refresh response. Requests time out after about 10 seconds.

### 4) Cancel a ChatGPT login

```json
{ "method": "account/login/cancel", "id": 4, "params": { "loginId": "<uuid>" } }
{ "method": "account/login/completed", "params": { "loginId": "<uuid>", "success": false, "error": "..." } }
```

### 5) Logout

```json

Field notes:

- `rateLimits` is the backward-compatible single-bucket view.
- `rateLimitsByLimitId` (when present) is the multi-bucket view keyed by metered `limit_id` (for example `codex`).
- `limitId` is the metered bucket identifier.
- `limitName` is an optional user-facing label for the bucket.
- `usedPercent` is current usage within the quota window.
- `windowDurationMins` is the quota window length.
- `resetsAt` is a Unix timestamp (seconds) for the next reset.
